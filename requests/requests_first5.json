        "content": "the picture shows several stages of one and the same spermatozoon - only one penetrates the ovum Illustration depicting ovulation and fertilization . Human fertilization is the union of a human egg and sperm , usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube . The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell , or fertilized egg , initiating prenatal development . Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century . The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum . The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation , follows with ovulation , and finishes with fertilization . Various exceptions to this sequence are possible , including artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , external ejaculation without copulation , or copulation shortly after ovulation . Upon encountering the secondary oocyte , the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg . The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg 's plasma membrane , the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus . In vitro fertilization ( IVF ) is a process by which egg cells are fertilized by sperm outside the womb , in vitro .
