Human fertilization is the union of a human egg and sperm , usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube . The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell , or fertilized egg , initiating prenatal development . Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century . The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum . The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation , follows with ovulation , and finishes with fertilization . Various exceptions to this sequence are possible , including artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , external ejaculation without copulation , or copulation shortly after ovulation . Upon encountering the secondary oocyte , the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg . The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg 's plasma membrane , the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus . In vitro fertilization ( IVF ) is a process by which egg cells are fertilized by sperm outside the womb , in vitro .

There were also reported instances of Acadian settlers marrying Indigenous spouses according to Mi'kmaq rites , and subsequently living in Mi'kmaq communities . Many settlers also brought French wives with them to Acadia , such as La Tour 's second wife , Françoise - Marie Jacquelin , who joined him in Acadia in 1640 .

In Europe in the early 15th century the letters `` P '' and `` M '' were generally used . The symbols ( P with line p̄ for più , i.e. , plus , and M with line m̄ for meno , i.e. , minus ) appeared for the first time in Luca Pacioli 's mathematics compendium , Summa de arithmetica , geometria , proportioni et proportionalità , first printed and published in Venice in 1494 . The + is a simplification of the Latin `` et '' ( comparable to the ampersand & ) . The − may be derived from a tilde written over m when used to indicate subtraction ; or it may come from a shorthand version of the letter m itself . In his 1489 treatise Johannes Widmann referred to the symbols − and + as minus and mer ( Modern German mehr ; `` more '' ) : `` was − ist , das ist minus , und das + ist das mer '' . They were n't used for addition and subtraction here , but to indicate surplus and deficit ; their first use in their modern sense appears in a book by Henricus Grammateus in 1518 . Robert Recorde , the designer of the equals sign , introduced plus and minus to Britain in 1557 in The Whetstone of Witte : `` There be other 2 signes in often use of which the first is made thus + and betokeneth more : the other is thus made -- and betokeneth lesse .

On December 8 , 2014 , CBS announced that the winner of the second male model online competition was James O'Halloran . Production staff ( edit ) The game show production team of Mark Goodson and Bill Todman was responsible for producing the original as well as the revival versions of the game show . Goodson - Todman staffer Bob Stewart is credited with creating the original version of The Price Is Right . Roger Dobkowitz was the producer from 1984 to 2008 , having worked with the program as a production staffer since the show 's debut after graduating from San Francisco State University . Occasionally , Dobkowitz appeared on - camera when answering a question posed by the host , usually relating to the show 's history or records . When he left the show at the end of season 36 , Variety reported that it was unclear whether he was retiring or was fired , although Carey indicated in a later interview with Esquire that Dobkowitz was fired . As of 2011 , the show uses multiple producers , all long - time staffers . Adam Sandler ( not to be confused with the actor ) is the producer of the show . Stan Blits , who joined the show in 1980 and Sue MacIntyre are the co-producers . Kathy Greco joined the show in 1975 and became producer in 2008 ; she announced her retirement October 8 , 2010 on the show 's website , effective at the end of the December 2010 tapings . Her last episode as producer , which aired January 27 , 2011 , featured a theme in tribute to her . The show 's official website featured a series of videos including an interview with Greco as a tribute to her 35 years in the days leading up to her final episode . Frank Wayne , a Goodson - Todman staffer since the 1950s , was the original executive producer of the CBS version of the show . Barker assumed that role after Wayne 's death in March 1988 , as previously stated . Previous producers have included Jay Wolpert , Barbara Hunter and Phil Wayne Rossi ( Wayne 's son ) . Michael Dimich assumed the director 's chair in June 2011 . Marc Breslow , Paul Alter , Bart Eskander and Rich DiPirro each served long stints previously as director . Former associate directors Andrew Felsher and Fred Witten , as well as technical director Glenn Koch , have directed episodes strictly on a fill - in basis . Sandler began directing episodes in 2012 , and became the official director in 2013 . Aside from Barker , the show 's production staff remained intact after Carey became host . FremantleMedia executive Syd Vinnedge was named the program 's new executive producer , with Richards becoming co-executive producer after Dobkowitz 's departure . Richards was a candidate to replace Barker as host in 2007 , before Carey was ultimately chosen . Richards succeeded Vinnedge as executive producer when the 2009 -- 10 season started , with Tracy Verna Soiseth joining Richards as co-executive producer in 2010 . Vinnedge remains credited as an executive consultant to the show .

Pulse evaluation at the radial artery . Recommended points to evaluate pulse In medicine , a pulse represents the tactile arterial palpation of the heartbeat by trained fingertips . The pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an artery to be compressed near the surface of the body , such as at the neck ( carotid artery ) , wrist ( radial artery ) , at the groin ( femoral artery ) , behind the knee ( popliteal artery ) , near the ankle joint ( posterior tibial artery ) , and on foot ( dorsalis pedis artery ) . Pulse ( or the count of arterial pulse per minute ) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate . The heart rate can also be measured by listening to the heart beat by auscultation , traditionally using a stethoscope and counting it for a minute . The radial pulse is commonly measured using three fingers . This has a reason : the finger closest to the heart is used to occlude the pulse pressure , the middle finger is used get a crude estimate of the blood pressure , and the finger most distal to the heart ( usually the ring finger ) is used to nullify the effect of the ulnar pulse as the two arteries are connected via the palmar arches ( superficial and deep ) . The study of the pulse is known as sphygmology .

You have these great moments and then you have these less great moments in life and in Los Angeles and we see it happen in the story . I was thinking about that idea a little bit and just trying to compose a melody that I thought was shapely and beautiful .
