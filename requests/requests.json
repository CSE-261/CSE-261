Human fertilization is the union of a human egg and sperm , usually occurring in the ampulla of the fallopian tube . The result of this union is the production of a zygote cell , or fertilized egg , initiating prenatal development . Scientists discovered the dynamics of human fertilization in the nineteenth century . The process of fertilization involves a sperm fusing with an ovum . The most common sequence begins with ejaculation during copulation , follows with ovulation , and finishes with fertilization . Various exceptions to this sequence are possible , including artificial insemination , in vitro fertilization , external ejaculation without copulation , or copulation shortly after ovulation . Upon encountering the secondary oocyte , the acrosome of the sperm produces enzymes which allow it to burrow through the outer jelly coat of the egg . The sperm plasma then fuses with the egg 's plasma membrane , the sperm head disconnects from its flagellum and the egg travels down the Fallopian tube to reach the uterus . In vitro fertilization ( IVF ) is a process by which egg cells are fertilized by sperm outside the womb , in vitro .

This would come back to taunt Emma in the present day , as Fiona returns to use that weakness to take Emma 's heart before unleashing a new curse on her wedding day , with help from Gold by freezing her family . When Henry discovers the page in the book that reveals the song in Emma 's heart will make her stronger , not only does it embolden Emma , it stops Fiona from crushing her heart , but Fiona still tells Emma that the battle will continue . On their wedding day , Emma and Hook finally marry , just in time for the dark clouds of the Black Fairy 's curse to erupt from the clock tower and engulf them at 6 : 00 PM , setting up the final battle . 132 133 21 22 `` The Final Battle '' Steve Pearlman Ralph Hemecker Edward Kitsis & Adam Horowitz May 14 , 2017 ( 2017 - 05 - 14 ) 2.95 Fiona 's curse alters Storybrooke , institutionalizing Emma and leaving only Henry and Gold `` awake , '' while sending Emma 's other allies to their home realms . The Final Battle begins over Emma 's belief ; if she stops believing in the realms of story , they will be consumed by the Darkness and cease to exist . If all the realms are destroyed , Fiona would gain unchecked powers and be able to break the Laws of Magic at will . In the Enchanted Forest , the banished characters gather at Regina 's castle ; David and Hook obtain a magic bean and the Evil Queen sacrifices herself , holding off the Darkness to delay the group 's destruction . Fiona convinces Emma to destroy the book , but Henry hand - draws one that restores her belief in time to save everyone in the castle . Gold kills Fiona , who had hidden Belle and turned her into a coward ; this breaks the Curse , which restores everyone 's memories and reunites them in Storybrooke . However , Gideon is still under orders to kill Emma . Gold attempts to free Gideon 's heart ; however , a spell cast by the Black Fairy prevents him from doing so . Emma lays down her sword , allowing Gideon to impale her ; this releases Emma 's light magic and ends the battle . With both Gold and Emma having chosen good , Gideon is returned to infancy and the realms are restored , and those who died in the crisis are revived . The characters embark on their `` happy beginnings . '' Many years later in the New Enchanted Forest , an adult Henry vanishes while defending his daughter Lucy from an unidentified entity . Guided by Tiger Lily , Lucy travels to Seattle , where Henry no longer remembers her . Production ( edit ) Development ( edit ) Executive producers Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis announced that they were ending the half - season arc structure that was seen in seasons three through five , with Horowitz saying , `` We 're also planning a 22 - episode story as opposed to breaking it up into two halves this year . It has been really exciting and fun . '' Kitsis added : `` We",

In Europe in the early 15th century the letters `` P '' and `` M '' were generally used . The symbols ( P with line p̄ for più , i.e. , plus , and M with line m̄ for meno , i.e. , minus ) appeared for the first time in Luca Pacioli 's mathematics compendium , Summa de arithmetica , geometria , proportioni et proportionalità , first printed and published in Venice in 1494 . The + is a simplification of the Latin `` et '' ( comparable to the ampersand & ) . The − may be derived from a tilde written over m when used to indicate subtraction ; or it may come from a shorthand version of the letter m itself . In his 1489 treatise Johannes Widmann referred to the symbols − and + as minus and mer ( Modern German mehr ; `` more '' ) : `` was − ist , das ist minus , und das + ist das mer '' . They were n't used for addition and subtraction here , but to indicate surplus and deficit ; their first use in their modern sense appears in a book by Henricus Grammateus in 1518 . Robert Recorde , the designer of the equals sign , introduced plus and minus to Britain in 1557 in The Whetstone of Witte : `` There be other 2 signes in often use of which the first is made thus + and betokeneth more : the other is thus made -- and betokeneth lesse .

Many consider the retina and the optic nerve ( cranial nerve II ) , as well as the olfactory nerves ( cranial nerve I ) and olfactory epithelium as parts of the CNS , synapsing directly on brain tissue without intermediate ganglia . As such , the olfactory epithelium is the only central nervous tissue in direct contact with the environment , which opens up for therapeutic treatments . The CNS is contained within the dorsal body cavity , with the brain housed in the cranial cavity and the spinal cord in the spinal canal . In vertebrates , the brain is protected by the skull , while the spinal cord is protected by the vertebrae . The brain and spinal cord are both enclosed in the meninges .

This contest was scheduled to be repeated in 2014 , with auditions taking place during the FIFA World Cup break between May and July 2014 . On December 8 , 2014 , CBS announced that the winner of the second male model online competition was James O'Halloran . Production staff ( edit ) The game show production team of Mark Goodson and Bill Todman was responsible for producing the original as well as the revival versions of the game show . Goodson - Todman staffer Bob Stewart is credited with creating the original version of The Price Is Right . Roger Dobkowitz was the producer from 1984 to 2008 , having worked with the program as a production staffer since the show 's debut after graduating from San Francisco State University . Occasionally , Dobkowitz appeared on - camera when answering a question posed by the host , usually relating to the show 's history or records . When he left the show at the end of season 36 , Variety reported that it was unclear whether he was retiring or was fired , although Carey indicated in a later interview with Esquire that Dobkowitz was fired . As of 2011 , the show uses multiple producers , all long - time staffers . Adam Sandler ( not to be confused with the actor ) is the producer of the show . Stan Blits , who joined the show in 1980 and Sue MacIntyre are the co-producers . Kathy Greco joined the show in 1975 and became producer in 2008 ; she announced her retirement October 8 , 2010 on the show 's website , effective at the end of the December 2010 tapings . Her last episode as producer , which aired January 27 , 2011 , featured a theme in tribute to her . The show 's official website featured a series of videos including an interview with Greco as a tribute to her 35 years in the days leading up to her final episode . Frank Wayne , a Goodson - Todman staffer since the 1950s , was the original executive producer of the CBS version of the show . Barker assumed that role after Wayne 's death in March 1988 , as previously stated . Previous producers have included Jay Wolpert , Barbara Hunter and Phil Wayne Rossi ( Wayne 's son ) . Michael Dimich assumed the director 's chair in June 2011 . Marc Breslow , Paul Alter , Bart Eskander and Rich DiPirro each served long stints previously as director . Former associate directors Andrew Felsher and Fred Witten , as well as technical director Glenn Koch , have directed episodes strictly on a fill - in basis . Sandler began directing episodes in 2012 , and became the official director in 2013 . Aside from Barker , the show 's production staff remained intact after Carey became host . FremantleMedia executive Syd Vinnedge was named the program 's new executive producer , with Richards becoming co-executive producer after Dobkowitz 's departure . Richards was a candidate to replace Barker as host in 2007 , before Carey was ultimately chosen . Richards succeeded Vinnedge as executive producer when the 2009 -- 10 season started , with Tracy Verna Soiseth joining Richards as co-executive producer in 2010 . Vinnedge remains credited as an executive consultant to the show . Production ( edit ) Audience and contestant selection ( edit ) Many audience members arrive early on the day of a taping , and often camp out the night before to attend .

Pulse evaluation at the radial artery . Recommended points to evaluate pulse In medicine , a pulse represents the tactile arterial palpation of the heartbeat by trained fingertips . The pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an artery to be compressed near the surface of the body , such as at the neck ( carotid artery ) , wrist ( radial artery ) , at the groin ( femoral artery ) , behind the knee ( popliteal artery ) , near the ankle joint ( posterior tibial artery ) , and on foot ( dorsalis pedis artery ) . Pulse ( or the count of arterial pulse per minute ) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate . The heart rate can also be measured by listening to the heart beat by auscultation , traditionally using a stethoscope and counting it for a minute . The radial pulse is commonly measured using three fingers . This has a reason : the finger closest to the heart is used to occlude the pulse pressure , the middle finger is used get a crude estimate of the blood pressure , and the finger most distal to the heart ( usually the ring finger ) is used to nullify the effect of the ulnar pulse as the two arteries are connected via the palmar arches ( superficial and deep ) .

You have these great moments and then you have these less great moments in life and in Los Angeles and we see it happen in the story .

It is at the neuromuscular junction that a motor neuron is able to transmit a signal to the muscle fiber , causing muscle contraction . Muscles require innervation to function -- and even just to maintain muscle tone , avoiding atrophy . Synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction begins when an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal of a motor neuron , which activates voltage - dependent calcium channels to allow calcium ions to enter the neuron . Calcium ions bind to sensor proteins ( synaptotagmin ) on synaptic vesicles , triggering vesicle fusion with the cell membrane and subsequent neurotransmitter release from the motor neuron into the synaptic cleft . In vertebrates , motor neurons release acetylcholine ( ACh ) , a small molecule neurotransmitter , which diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) on the cell membrane of the muscle fiber , also known as the sarcolemma . nAChRs are ionotropic receptors , meaning they serve as ligand - gated ion channels . The binding of ACh to the receptor can depolarize the muscle fiber , causing a cascade that eventually results in muscle contraction . Neuromuscular junction diseases can be of genetic and autoimmune origin . Genetic disorders , such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy , can arise from mutated structural proteins that comprise the neuromuscular junction , whereas autoimmune diseases , such as myasthenia gravis , occur when antibodies are produced against nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the sarcolemma .

The family soon appears before a judge who researches the law , and determines that its intent is to ensure a full - time caregiver is in the household . With Charley meeting that role , and having had a change of heart about Ernie , Charley assents to a legal fiction declaring him `` housemother '' to the Douglas family . While the three sons were always central to the storyline , several major changes took place by the late 1960s . In the spring of 1967 , the ratings for the series began to sag and My Three Sons finished its seventh season in 31st place in the Nielsen ratings . It was decided that the 1967 - 1968 season would bring the program not only a new time slot , but also new storylines to spice up the ratings . In the fall of 1967 , CBS moved My Three Sons to Saturday night at 8 : 30 pm .

At the end of the 1967 - 1968 season , the ratings had improved from the previous year with the series placing at 24th in the Nielsens . The following season , the newlyweds discover that Katie is pregnant , and she gives birth to triplets named Robert , Steven , and Charles . Although originally played by sets of uncredited twins , these babies were played uncredited by Guy , Gunnar , and Garth Swanson . The most familiar triplets in the show 's last two seasons are played by Michael , Daniel , and Joseph Todd . The following year in the tenth season , 1969 - 1970 , Steve remarries , taking widowed teacher Barbara Harper ( Beverly Garland ) as his wife ; she brings with her a 5 - year - old daughter , Dorothy `` Dodie '' ( Dawn Lyn ) , so Steven now had a stepdaughter whom he also subsequently adopts .
